  Usain Bolt tends to make things look easy, but the Jamaican superstar took it
  to a new level on his way to a third consecutive Olympic gold in the 100-meter
  dash Sunday night. Before he even got to that point, the lasting image of
  Bolt's dominant night came in the semifinal heat, before he reached the finish
  line.
